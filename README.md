This is an implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algortithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with symetric arcs. Created for my project in the course **Computational Intelligence**.

##Â launch the project

- Clone and move into the repository
- Execute the main file `python3 main.py` 
  - This will execute all the files in the `instances folder`
  - You can add 2 parameters `-s` / `single` and the name of the file to perform the algorithm on one file : `python3 main.py -s gr17.tsp`

- With the default execution you will find all the results in a `res.txt` file.
